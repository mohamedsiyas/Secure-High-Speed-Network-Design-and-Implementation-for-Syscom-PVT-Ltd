# Secure-High-Speed-Network-Design-and-Implementation-for-Syscom-PVT-Ltd

This report presents the design, configuration, and testing of a secure network infrastructure for Syscom (PVT) Ltd, a leading IT solutions provider. In response to the increasing complexity of network environments and the need for enhanced security, a comprehensive network architecture was developed to support the company's various departments, including Admin, Finance, Software, NOC, and Marketing.

The project involved the implementation of a hierarchical network design, leveraging VLANs for segmentation, EtherChannel for redundancy, and OSPF for dynamic routing. Security measures such as Access Control Lists (ACLs), Network Address Translation (NAT), and a robust firewall inspection policy were integrated to protect the network from internal and external threats. Secure remote access was ensured through SSH, and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) was configured to prevent network loops and ensure stability.

Rigorous testing was conducted to validate the network's performance, security, and reliability. The tests confirmed that the network met the design objectives, with successful communication across VLANs, proper enforcement of security policies, and effective redundancy mechanisms in place. The report also identifies areas for further improvement, including the implementation of advanced threat detection systems and enhanced network monitoring tools.

This project demonstrates a systematic approach to building a secure and scalable network infrastructure, capable of supporting Syscom (PVT) Ltd's current operations while providing a strong foundation for future growth.
